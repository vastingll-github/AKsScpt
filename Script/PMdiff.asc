== NAME

pmdiff - compares archives and report significant differences

== SYNOPSIS

pmdiff [-dzV?] [-B starttime] [-E endtime] [-p precision] [-q thres] [-S
starttime] [--skip-excluded] [--skip-missing] [-T endtime] [-x metric]
[-X file] [-Z timezone] archive1 [archive2]

== DESCRIPTION

*pmdiff* compares the average values for every metric in either one or
two sets of archives, in a given time window, for changes that are
likely to be of interest when searching for performance regressions.

The archive specifiers _archive1_ and _archive2_ may be comma-separated
lists of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or the
name of a directory containing one or more archives. Each archive in the
resulting set of archives must have been previously created using
*pmlogger*(1). The *pmlogsummary*(1) utility is used to obtain the
average values used for comparison.

There are two sorts of invocation of the tool: with either one or two
sets of archives.

In the first case, the only sensible command line requires use of all
four time window arguments. These are specified using the same time
window format described in *PCPIntro*(1), and are *-S*/*--start* and
*-T*/*--finish* for the start and end times of the first time window of
interest in the archive set, and *-B*/*--before* and *-E*/*--end* for
the start and end times of the second time window of interest.

In the second case, with two sets of archives, the *-B*/*--before* and
*-E*/*--end* options might be unnecessary. This might be the case, for
example, when comparing the same time window of two consecutive days
(usually two separate sets of archives), or a time window on the same
day of different weeks.

In either case, *pmdiff* produces a sorted summary of those metrics in
the specified window whose values have deviated the most from a minimal
threshold. The level of deviation is calculated by dividing the average
value of each metric in both logs, and then calculating whether the
ratio falls outside of a range considered normal. This ratio can be
adjusted using the *-q*/*--threshold* option, and by default it is 2
(i.e. report all metrics with average values that have more than doubled
in the two time windows or more than halved in the two time windows).

If the baseline value is zero and the comparison value is non-zero, the
ratio is reported as ``|+|'' (infinitely large). If the comparison value
is zero and the baseline value is non-zero, the ratio is reported as
``|-|'' (infinitely small).

Reported metrics are sorted in ascending ratio order.

Should any metrics be present in one window but missing from the other,
a diagnostic will be displayed listing each missing metric and the
archive set from which it was missing.

Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before being
evaluated.

== OPTIONS

The available command line options are:

*-d*, *--keep*::
  Debug mode, keep intermediate files.
*-B* _time_, **--begin**=__time__::
  Start _time_ for the second time window.
*-E* _time_, **--end**=__time__::
  End _time_ for the second time window.
*-p* _precision_, **--precision**=__precision__::
  Print all floating point numbers with _precision_ digits after the
  decimal place.
*-q* _threshold_, **--threshold**=__threshold__::
  Change the _threshold_ for interesting metrics, see above for more
  details.
*-S* _time_, **--start**=__time__::
  Start _time_ of the first time window.
*-T* _time_, **--finish**=__time__::
  End _time_ of the first time window.
*-V*, *--version*::
  Display version number and exit.
*-x* _metric_::
  Compare each _metric_ in each archive set in the time windows
  specified to a given *egrep*(1) pattern, excluding those that match
  from the report output.
*-X* _file_::
  Allows a _file_ to be specified which containing *egrep*(1) patterns
  which are applied to the metric names to optionally exclude some from
  the report.
*-z*, *--hostzone*::
  Use the local timezone from the given archive set.
*-Z* _timezone_, **--timezone**=__timezone__::
  Changes the timezone in the archive labels to _timezone_ in the format
  of the environment variable *TZ* as described in *environ*(7).
*-?*, *--help*::
  Display usage message and exit.
*--skip-excluded*::
  Cull the list of names of metrics being excluded from the output.
*--skip-missing*::
  By default, *pmdiff* will report the names of any metrics that are in
  one archive set but not the other. This option suppresses that
  reporting.

== FILES

_$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/<hostname>_::
  Default directory for PCP archives containing performance metric
  values collected from the host _hostname_.

== PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment variables with the prefix *PCP_* are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
_/etc/pcp.conf_ contains the local values for these variables. The
*$PCP_CONF* variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in *pcp.conf*(5).

== SEE ALSO

*PCPIntro*(1), *pmlogger*(1), *pmlogsummary*(1), *egrep*(1),
*pcp.conf*(5) and *pcp.env*(5).
