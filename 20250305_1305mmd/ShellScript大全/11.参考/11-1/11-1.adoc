*pcre2grep [options] [long options] [pattern] [path1 path2 ...]*

 +
link:#TOC1[DESCRIPTION] +

*pcre2grep* searches files for character patterns, in the same way as
other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE2 regular expression library
to support patterns that are compatible with the regular expressions of
Perl 5. See link:pcre2syntax.html[*pcre2syntax*(3)] for a
quick-reference summary of pattern syntax, or
link:pcre2pattern.html[*pcre2pattern*(3)] for a full description of the
syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that PCRE2 supports.

Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a separate file,
are given without delimiters. For example:

....
  pcre2grep Thursday /etc/motd
....

If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by surrounding a pattern
with slashes, as is common in Perl scripts), they are interpreted as
part of the pattern. Quotes can of course be used to delimit patterns on
the command line because they are interpreted by the shell, and indeed
quotes are required if a pattern contains white space or shell
metacharacters.

The first argument that follows any option settings is treated as the
single pattern to be matched when neither *-e* nor *-f* is present.
Conversely, when one or both of these options are used to specify
patterns, all arguments are treated as path names. At least one of *-e*,
*-f*, or an argument pattern must be provided.

If no files are specified, *pcre2grep* reads the standard input. The
standard input can also be referenced by a name consisting of a single
hyphen. For example:

....
  pcre2grep some-pattern file1 - file3
....

By default, input files are searched line by line, so pattern assertions
about the beginning and end of a subject string (^, $, \A, \Z, and \z)
match at the beginning and end of each line. When a line matches a
pattern, it is copied to the standard output, and if there is more than
one file, the file name is output at the start of each line, followed by
a colon. However, there are options that can change how *pcre2grep*
behaves. For example, the *-M* option makes it possible to search for
strings that span line boundaries. What defines a line boundary is
controlled by the *-N* (*--newline*) option. The *-h* and *-H* options
control whether or not file names are shown, and the *-Z* option changes
the file name terminator to a zero byte.

The amount of memory used for buffering files that are being scanned is
controlled by parameters that can be set by the *--buffer-size* and
*--max-buffer-size* options. The first of these sets the size of buffer
that is obtained at the start of processing. If an input file contains
very long lines, a larger buffer may be needed; this is handled by
automatically extending the buffer, up to the limit specified by
*--max-buffer-size*. The default values for these parameters can be set
when *pcre2grep* is built; if nothing is specified, the defaults are set
to 20KiB and 1MiB respectively. An error occurs if a line is too long
and the buffer can no longer be expanded.

The block of memory that is actually used is three times the "buffer
size", to allow for buffering "before" and "after" lines. If the buffer
size is too small, fewer than requested "before" and "after" lines may
be output.

When matching with a multiline pattern, the size of the buffer must be
at least half of the maximum match expected or the pattern might fail to
match.

Patterns can be no longer than 8KiB or BUFSIZ bytes, whichever is the
greater. BUFSIZ is defined in *<stdio.h>*. When there is more than one
pattern (specified by the use of *-e* and/or *-f*), each pattern is
applied to each line in the order in which they are defined, except that
all the *-e* patterns are tried before the *-f* patterns.

By default, as soon as one pattern matches a line, no further patterns
are considered. However, if *--colour* (or *--color*) is used to colour
the matching substrings, or if *--only-matching*, *--file-offsets*,
*--line-offsets*, or *--output* is used to output only the part of the
line that matched (either shown literally, or as an offset), the
behaviour is different. In this situation, all the patterns are applied
to the line. If there is more than one match, the one that begins
nearest to the start of the subject is processed; if there is more than
one match at that position, the one with the longest matching substring
is processed; if the matching substrings are equal, the first match
found is processed.

Scanning with all the patterns resumes immediately following the match,
so that later matches on the same line can be found. Note, however, that
an overlapping match that starts in the middle of another match will not
be processed.

The above behaviour was changed at release 10.41 to be more compatible
with GNU grep. In earlier releases, *pcre2grep* did not recognize
matches from later patterns that were earlier in the subject.

Patterns that can match an empty string are accepted, but empty string
matches are never recognized. An example is the pattern
"(super)?(man)?", in which all components are optional. This pattern
finds all occurrences of both "super" and "man"; the output differs from
matching with "super|man" when only the matching substrings are being
shown.

If the *LC_ALL* or *LC_CTYPE* environment variable is set, *pcre2grep*
uses the value to set a locale when calling the PCRE2 library. The
*--locale* option can be used to override this.

 +
link:#TOC1[SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES] +

Compile-time options for *pcre2grep* can set it up to use *libz* or
*libbz2* for reading compressed files whose names end in *.gz* or
*.bz2*, respectively. You can find out whether your *pcre2grep* binary
has support for one or both of these file types by running it with the
*--help* option. If the appropriate support is not present, all files
are treated as plain text. The standard input is always so treated. If a
file with a *.gz* or *.bz2* extension is not in fact compressed, it is
read as a plain text file. When input is from a compressed .gz or .bz2
file, the *--line-buffered* option is ignored.

 +
link:#TOC1[BINARY FILES] +

By default, a file that contains a binary zero byte within the first
1024 bytes is identified as a binary file, and is processed specially.
However, if the newline type is specified as NUL, that is, the line
terminator is a binary zero, the test for a binary file is not applied.
See the *--binary-files* option for a means of changing the way binary
files are handled.

 +
link:#TOC1[BINARY ZEROS IN PATTERNS] +

Patterns passed from the command line are strings that are terminated by
a binary zero, so cannot contain internal zeros. However, patterns that
are read from a file via the *-f* option may contain binary zeros.

 +
link:#TOC1[OPTIONS] +

The order in which some of the options appear can affect the output. For
example, both the *-H* and *-l* options affect the printing of file
names. Whichever comes later in the command line will be the one that
takes effect. Similarly, except where noted below, if an option is given
twice, the later setting is used. Numerical values for options may be
followed by K or M, to signify multiplication by 1024 or 1024*1024
respectively.

*--* This terminates the list of options. It is useful if the next item
on the command line starts with a hyphen but is not an option. This
allows for the processing of patterns and file names that start with
hyphens.

*-A* _number_, *--after-context=*_number_ Output up to _number_ lines of
context after each matching line. Fewer lines are output if the next
match or the end of the file is reached, or if the processing buffer
size has been set too small. If file names and/or line numbers are being
output, a hyphen separator is used instead of a colon for the context
lines (the *-Z* option can be used to change the file name terminator to
a zero byte). A line containing "--" is output between each group of
lines, unless they are in fact contiguous in the input file. The value
of _number_ is expected to be relatively small. When *-c* is used, *-A*
is ignored.

*-a*, *--text* Treat binary files as text. This is equivalent to
**--binary-files**=__text__.

*--allow-lookaround-bsk* PCRE2 now forbids the use of \K in lookarounds
by default, in line with Perl. This option causes *pcre2grep* to set the
PCRE2_EXTRA_ALLOW_LOOKAROUND_BSK option, which enables this somewhat
dangerous usage.

*-B* _number_, *--before-context=*_number_ Output up to _number_ lines
of context before each matching line. Fewer lines are output if the
previous match or the start of the file is within _number_ lines, or if
the processing buffer size has been set too small. If file names and/or
line numbers are being output, a hyphen separator is used instead of a
colon for the context lines (the *-Z* option can be used to change the
file name terminator to a zero byte). A line containing "--" is output
between each group of lines, unless they are in fact contiguous in the
input file. The value of _number_ is expected to be relatively small.
When *-c* is used, *-B* is ignored.

*--binary-files=*_word_ Specify how binary files are to be processed. If
the word is "binary" (the default), pattern matching is performed on
binary files, but the only output is "Binary file <name> matches" when a
match succeeds. If the word is "text", which is equivalent to the *-a*
or *--text* option, binary files are processed in the same way as any
other file. In this case, when a match succeeds, the output may be
binary garbage, which can have nasty effects if sent to a terminal. If
the word is "without-match", which is equivalent to the *-I* option,
binary files are not processed at all; they are assumed not to be of
interest and are skipped without causing any output or affecting the
return code.

*--buffer-size=*_number_ Set the parameter that controls how much memory
is obtained at the start of processing for buffering files that are
being scanned. See also *--max-buffer-size* below.

*-C* _number_, *--context=*_number_ Output _number_ lines of context
both before and after each matching line. This is equivalent to setting
both *-A* and *-B* to the same value.

*-c*, *--count* Do not output lines from the files that are being
scanned; instead output the number of lines that would have been shown,
either because they matched, or, if *-v* is set, because they failed to
match. By default, this count is exactly the same as the number of lines
that would have been output, but if the *-M* (multiline) option is used
(without *-v*), there may be more suppressed lines than the count (that
is, the number of matches). +
 +
If no lines are selected, the number zero is output. If several files
are being scanned, a count is output for each of them and the *-t*
option can be used to cause a total to be output at the end. However, if
the *--files-with-matches* option is also used, only those files whose
counts are greater than zero are listed. When *-c* is used, the *-A*,
*-B*, and *-C* options are ignored.

*--colour*, *--color* If this option is given without any data, it is
equivalent to "--colour=auto". If data is required, it must be given in
the same shell item, separated by an equals sign.

*--colour=*_value_, *--color=*_value_ This option specifies under what
circumstances the parts of a line that matched a pattern should be
coloured in the output. It is ignored if *--file-offsets*,
*--line-offsets*, or *--output* is set. By default, output is not
coloured. The value for the *--colour* option (which is optional, see
above) may be "never", "always", or "auto". In the latter case,
colouring happens only if the standard output is connected to a
terminal. More resources are used when colouring is enabled, because
*pcre2grep* has to search for all possible matches in a line, not just
one, in order to colour them all. +
 +
The colour that is used can be specified by setting one of the
environment variables PCRE2GREP_COLOUR, PCRE2GREP_COLOR,
PCREGREP_COLOUR, or PCREGREP_COLOR, which are checked in that order. If
none of these are set, *pcre2grep* looks for GREP_COLORS or GREP_COLOR
(in that order). The value of the variable should be a string of two
numbers, separated by a semicolon, except in the case of GREP_COLORS,
which must start with "ms=" or "mt=" followed by two semicolon-separated
colours, terminated by the end of the string or by a colon. If
GREP_COLORS does not start with "ms=" or "mt=" it is ignored, and
GREP_COLOR is checked. +
 +
If the string obtained from one of the above variables contains any
characters other than semicolon or digits, the setting is ignored and
the default colour is used. The string is copied directly into the
control string for setting colour on a terminal, so it is your
responsibility to ensure that the values make sense. If no relevant
environment variable is set, the default is "1;31", which gives red.

*-D* _action_, *--devices=*_action_ If an input path is not a regular
file or a directory, "action" specifies how it is to be processed. Valid
values are "read" (the default) or "skip" (silently skip the path).

*-d* _action_, *--directories=*_action_ If an input path is a directory,
"action" specifies how it is to be processed. Valid values are "read"
(the default in non-Windows environments, for compatibility with GNU
grep), "recurse" (equivalent to the *-r* option), or "skip" (silently
skip the path, the default in Windows environments). In the "read" case,
directories are read as if they were ordinary files. In some operating
systems the effect of reading a directory like this is an immediate
end-of-file; in others it may provoke an error.

**--depth-limit**=__number__ See *--match-limit* below.

*-E*, *--case-restrict* When case distinctions are being ignored in
Unicode mode, two ASCII letters (K and S) will by default match Unicode
characters U+212A (Kelvin sign) and U+017F (long S) respectively, as
well as their lower case ASCII counterparts. When this option is set,
case equivalences are restricted such that no ASCII character matches a
non-ASCII character, and vice versa.

*-e* _pattern_, *--regex=*_pattern_, *--regexp=*_pattern_ Specify a
pattern to be matched. This option can be used multiple times in order
to specify several patterns. It can also be used as a way of specifying
a single pattern that starts with a hyphen. When *-e* is used, no
argument pattern is taken from the command line; all arguments are
treated as file names. There is no limit to the number of patterns. They
are applied to each line in the order in which they are defined. +
 +
If *-f* is used with *-e*, the command line patterns are matched first,
followed by the patterns from the file(s), independent of the order in
which these options are specified.

**--exclude**=__pattern__ Files (but not directories) whose names match
the pattern are skipped without being processed. This applies to all
files, whether listed on the command line, obtained from *--file-list*,
or by scanning a directory. The pattern is a PCRE2 regular expression,
and is matched against the final component of the file name, not the
entire path. The *-F*, *-w*, and *-x* options do not apply to this
pattern. The option may be given any number of times in order to specify
multiple patterns. If a file name matches both an *--include* and an
*--exclude* pattern, it is excluded. There is no short form for this
option.

*--exclude-from=*_filename_ Treat each non-empty line of the file as the
data for an *--exclude* option. What constitutes a newline when reading
the file is the operating system's default. The *--newline* option has
no effect on this option. This option may be given more than once in
order to specify a number of files to read.

**--exclude-dir**=__pattern__ Directories whose names match the pattern
are skipped without being processed, whatever the setting of the
*--recursive* option. This applies to all directories, whether listed on
the command line, obtained from *--file-list*, or by scanning a parent
directory. The pattern is a PCRE2 regular expression, and is matched
against the final component of the directory name, not the entire path.
The *-F*, *-w*, and *-x* options do not apply to this pattern. The
option may be given any number of times in order to specify more than
one pattern. If a directory matches both *--include-dir* and
*--exclude-dir*, it is excluded. There is no short form for this option.

*-F*, *--fixed-strings* Interpret each data-matching pattern as a list
of fixed strings, separated by newlines, instead of as a regular
expression. What constitutes a newline for this purpose is controlled by
the *--newline* option. The *-w* (match as a word) and *-x* (match whole
line) options can be used with *-F*. They apply to each of the fixed
strings. A line is selected if any of the fixed strings are found in it
(subject to *-w* or *-x*, if present). This option applies only to the
patterns that are matched against the contents of files; it does not
apply to patterns specified by any of the *--include* or *--exclude*
options.

*-f* _filename_, *--file=*_filename_ Read patterns from the file, one
per line. As is the case with patterns on the command line, no
delimiters should be used. What constitutes a newline when reading the
file is the operating system's default interpretation of \n. The
*--newline* option has no effect on this option. Trailing white space is
removed from each line, and blank lines are ignored unless the
*--posix-pattern-file* option is also provided. An empty file contains
no patterns and therefore matches nothing. Patterns read from a file in
this way may contain binary zeros, which are treated as ordinary
character literals. +
 +
If this option is given more than once, all the specified files are
read. A data line is output if any of the patterns match it. A file name
can be given as "-" to refer to the standard input. When *-f* is used,
patterns specified on the command line using *-e* may also be present;
they are matched before the file's patterns. However, no pattern is
taken from the command line; all arguments are treated as the names of
paths to be searched.

**--file-list**=__filename__ Read a list of files and/or directories
that are to be scanned from the given file, one per line. What
constitutes a newline when reading the file is the operating system's
default. Trailing white space is removed from each line, and blank lines
are ignored. These paths are processed before any that are listed on the
command line. The file name can be given as "-" to refer to the standard
input. If *--file* and *--file-list* are both specified as "-", patterns
are read first. This is useful only when the standard input is a
terminal, from which further lines (the list of files) can be read after
an end-of-file indication. If this option is given more than once, all
the specified files are read.

*--file-offsets* Instead of showing lines or parts of lines that match,
show each match as an offset from the start of the file and a length,
separated by a comma. In this mode, *--colour* has no effect, and no
context is shown. That is, the *-A*, *-B*, and *-C* options are ignored.
If there is more than one match in a line, each of them is shown
separately. This option is mutually exclusive with *--output*,
*--line-offsets*, and *--only-matching*.

**--group-separator**=__text__ Output this text string instead of two
hyphens between groups of lines when *-A*, *-B*, or *-C* is in use. See
also *--no-group-separator*.

*-H*, *--with-filename* Force the inclusion of the file name at the
start of output lines when searching a single file. The file name is not
normally shown in this case. By default, for matching lines, the file
name is followed by a colon; for context lines, a hyphen separator is
used. The *-Z* option can be used to change the terminator to a zero
byte. If a line number is also being output, it follows the file name.
When the *-M* option causes a pattern to match more than one line, only
the first is preceded by the file name. This option overrides any
previous *-h*, *-l*, or *-L* options.

*-h*, *--no-filename* Suppress the output file names when searching
multiple files. File names are normally shown when multiple files are
searched. By default, for matching lines, the file name is followed by a
colon; for context lines, a hyphen separator is used. The *-Z* option
can be used to change the terminator to a zero byte. If a line number is
also being output, it follows the file name. This option overrides any
previous *-H*, *-L*, or *-l* options.

**--heap-limit**=__number__ See *--match-limit* below.

*--help* Output a help message, giving brief details of the command
options and file type support, and then exit. Anything else on the
command line is ignored.

*-I* Ignore binary files. This is equivalent to
**--binary-files**=__without-match__.

*-i*, *--ignore-case* Ignore upper/lower case distinctions when pattern
matching. This applies when matching path names for inclusion or
exclusion as well as when matching lines in files.

**--include**=__pattern__ If any *--include* patterns are specified, the
only files that are processed are those whose names match one of the
patterns and do not match an *--exclude* pattern. This option does not
affect directories, but it applies to all files, whether listed on the
command line, obtained from *--file-list*, or by scanning a directory.
The pattern is a PCRE2 regular expression, and is matched against the
final component of the file name, not the entire path. The *-F*, *-w*,
and *-x* options do not apply to this pattern. The option may be given
any number of times. If a file name matches both an *--include* and an
*--exclude* pattern, it is excluded. There is no short form for this
option.

*--include-from=*_filename_ Treat each non-empty line of the file as the
data for an *--include* option. What constitutes a newline for this
purpose is the operating system's default. The *--newline* option has no
effect on this option. This option may be given any number of times; all
the files are read.

**--include-dir**=__pattern__ If any *--include-dir* patterns are
specified, the only directories that are processed are those whose names
match one of the patterns and do not match an *--exclude-dir* pattern.
This applies to all directories, whether listed on the command line,
obtained from *--file-list*, or by scanning a parent directory. The
pattern is a PCRE2 regular expression, and is matched against the final
component of the directory name, not the entire path. The *-F*, *-w*,
and *-x* options do not apply to this pattern. The option may be given
any number of times. If a directory matches both *--include-dir* and
*--exclude-dir*, it is excluded. There is no short form for this option.

*-L*, *--files-without-match* Instead of outputting lines from the
files, just output the names of the files that do not contain any lines
that would have been output. Each file name is output once, on a
separate line by default, but if the *-Z* option is set, they are
separated by zero bytes instead of newlines. This option overrides any
previous *-H*, *-h*, or *-l* options.

*-l*, *--files-with-matches* Instead of outputting lines from the files,
just output the names of the files containing lines that would have been
output. Each file name is output once, on a separate line, but if the
*-Z* option is set, they are separated by zero bytes instead of
newlines. Searching normally stops as soon as a matching line is found
in a file. However, if the *-c* (count) option is also used, matching
continues in order to obtain the correct count, and those files that
have at least one match are listed along with their counts. Using this
option with *-c* is a way of suppressing the listing of files with no
matches that occurs with *-c* on its own. This option overrides any
previous *-H*, *-h*, or *-L* options.

**--label**=__name__ This option supplies a name to be used for the
standard input when file names are being output. If not supplied,
"(standard input)" is used. There is no short form for this option.

*--line-buffered* When this option is given, non-compressed input is
read and processed line by line, and the output is flushed after each
write. By default, input is read in large chunks, unless *pcre2grep* can
determine that it is reading from a terminal, which is currently
possible only in Unix-like environments or Windows. Output to terminal
is normally automatically flushed by the operating system. This option
can be useful when the input or output is attached to a pipe and you do
not want *pcre2grep* to buffer up large amounts of data. However, its
use will affect performance, and the *-M* (multiline) option ceases to
work. When input is from a compressed .gz or .bz2 file,
*--line-buffered* is ignored.

*--line-offsets* Instead of showing lines or parts of lines that match,
show each match as a line number, the offset from the start of the line,
and a length. The line number is terminated by a colon (as usual; see
the *-n* option), and the offset and length are separated by a comma. In
this mode, *--colour* has no effect, and no context is shown. That is,
the *-A*, *-B*, and *-C* options are ignored. If there is more than one
match in a line, each of them is shown separately. This option is
mutually exclusive with *--output*, *--file-offsets*, and
*--only-matching*.

**--locale**=__locale-name__ This option specifies a locale to be used
for pattern matching. It overrides the value in the *LC_ALL* or
*LC_CTYPE* environment variables. If no locale is specified, the PCRE2
library's default (usually the "C" locale) is used. There is no short
form for this option.

*-M*, *--multiline* Allow patterns to match more than one line. When
this option is set, the PCRE2 library is called in "multiline" mode, and
a match is allowed to continue past the end of the initial line and onto
one or more subsequent lines. +
 +
Patterns used with *-M* may usefully contain literal newline characters
and internal occurrences of ^ and $ characters, because in multiline
mode these can match at internal newlines. Because *pcre2grep* is
scanning multiple lines, the \Z and \z assertions match only at the end
of the last line in the file. The \A assertion matches at the start of
the first line of a match. This can be any line in the file; it is not
anchored to the first line. +
 +
The output for a successful match may consist of more than one line. The
first line is the line in which the match started, and the last line is
the line in which the match ended. If the matched string ends with a
newline sequence, the output ends at the end of that line. If *-v* is
set, none of the lines in a multi-line match are output. Once a match
has been handled, scanning restarts at the beginning of the line after
the one in which the match ended. +
 +
The newline sequence that separates multiple lines must be matched as
part of the pattern. For example, to find the phrase "regular
expression" in a file where "regular" might be at the end of a line and
"expression" at the start of the next line, you could use this command:

....
  pcre2grep -M 'regular\s+expression' <file>
....

The \s escape sequence matches any white space character, including
newlines, and is followed by + so as to match trailing white space on
the first line as well as possibly handling a two-character newline
sequence. +
 +
There is a limit to the number of lines that can be matched, imposed by
the way that *pcre2grep* buffers the input file as it scans it. With a
sufficiently large processing buffer, this should not be a problem. +
 +
The *-M* option does not work when input is read line by line (see
*--line-buffered*.)

*-m* _number_, **--max-count**=__number__ Stop processing after finding
_number_ matching lines, or non-matching lines if *-v* is also set. Any
trailing context lines are output after the final match. In multiline
mode, each multiline match counts as just one line for this purpose. If
this limit is reached when reading the standard input from a regular
file, the file is left positioned just after the last matching line. If
*-c* is also set, the count that is output is never greater than
_number_. This option has no effect if used with *-L*, *-l*, or *-q*, or
when just checking for a match in a binary file.

**--match-limit**=__number__ Processing some regular expression patterns
may take a very long time to search for all possible matching strings.
Others may require a very large amount of memory. There are three
options that set resource limits for matching. +
 +
The *--match-limit* option provides a means of limiting computing
resource usage when processing patterns that are not going to match, but
which have a very large number of possibilities in their search trees.
The classic example is a pattern that uses nested unlimited repeats.
Internally, PCRE2 has a counter that is incremented each time around its
main processing loop. If the value set by *--match-limit* is reached, an
error occurs. +
 +
The *--heap-limit* option specifies, as a number of kibibytes (units of
1024 bytes), the maximum amount of heap memory that may be used for
matching. +
 +
The *--depth-limit* option limits the depth of nested backtracking
points, which indirectly limits the amount of memory that is used. The
amount of memory needed for each backtracking point depends on the
number of capturing parentheses in the pattern, so the amount of memory
that is used before this limit acts varies from pattern to pattern. This
limit is of use only if it is set smaller than *--match-limit*. +
 +
There are no short forms for these options. The default limits can be
set when the PCRE2 library is compiled; if they are not specified, the
defaults are very large and so effectively unlimited.

**--max-buffer-size**=__number__ This limits the expansion of the
processing buffer, whose initial size can be set by *--buffer-size*. The
maximum buffer size is silently forced to be no smaller than the
starting buffer size.

*-N* _newline-type_, **--newline**=__newline-type__ Six different
conventions for indicating the ends of lines in scanned files are
supported. For example:

....
  pcre2grep -N CRLF 'some pattern' <file>
....

The newline type may be specified in upper, lower, or mixed case. If the
newline type is NUL, lines are separated by binary zero characters. The
other types are the single-character sequences CR (carriage return) and
LF (linefeed), the two-character sequence CRLF, an "anycrlf" type, which
recognizes any of the preceding three types, and an "any" type, for
which any Unicode line ending sequence is assumed to end a line. The
Unicode sequences are the three just mentioned, plus VT (vertical tab,
U+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029). +
 +
When the PCRE2 library is built, a default line-ending sequence is
specified. This is normally the standard sequence for the operating
system. Unless otherwise specified by this option, *pcre2grep* uses the
library's default. +
 +
This option makes it possible to use *pcre2grep* to scan files that have
come from other environments without having to modify their line
endings. If the data that is being scanned does not agree with the
convention set by this option, *pcre2grep* may behave in strange ways.
Note that this option does not apply to files specified by the *-f*,
*--exclude-from*, or *--include-from* options, which are expected to use
the operating system's standard newline sequence.

*-n*, *--line-number* Precede each output line by its line number in the
file, followed by a colon for matching lines or a hyphen for context
lines. If the file name is also being output, it precedes the line
number. When the *-M* option causes a pattern to match more than one
line, only the first is preceded by its line number. This option is
forced if *--line-offsets* is used.

*--no-group-separator* Do not output a separator between groups of lines
when *-A*, *-B*, or *-C* is in use. The default is to output a line
containing two hyphens. See also *--group-separator*.

*--no-jit* If the PCRE2 library is built with support for just-in-time
compiling (which speeds up matching), *pcre2grep* automatically makes
use of this, unless it was explicitly disabled at build time. This
option can be used to disable the use of JIT at run time. It is provided
for testing and working around problems. It should never be needed in
normal use.

*-O* _text_, **--output**=__text__ When there is a match, instead of
outputting the line that matched, output just the text specified in this
option, followed by an operating-system standard newline. In this mode,
*--colour* has no effect, and no context is shown. That is, the *-A*,
*-B*, and *-C* options are ignored. The *--newline* option has no effect
on this option, which is mutually exclusive with *--only-matching*,
*--file-offsets*, and *--line-offsets*. However, like *--only-matching*,
if there is more than one match in a line, each of them causes a line of
output. +
 +
Escape sequences starting with a dollar character may be used to insert
the contents of the matched part of the line and/or captured substrings
into the text. +
 +
$<digits> or $\{<digits>} is replaced by the captured substring of the
given decimal number; $& (or the legacy $0) substitutes the whole match.
If the number is greater than the number of capturing substrings, or if
the capture is unset, the replacement is empty. +
 +
$a is replaced by bell; $b by backspace; $e by escape; $f by form feed;
$n by newline; $r by carriage return; $t by tab; $v by vertical tab. +
 +
$o<digits> or $o\{<digits>} is replaced by the character whose code
point is the given octal number. In the first form, up to three octal
digits are processed. When more digits are needed in Unicode mode to
specify a wide character, the second form must be used. +
 +
$x<digits> or $x\{<digits>} is replaced by the character represented by
the given hexadecimal number. In the first form, up to two hexadecimal
digits are processed. When more digits are needed in Unicode mode to
specify a wide character, the second form must be used. +
 +
Any other character is substituted by itself. In particular, $$ is
replaced by a single dollar.

*-o*, *--only-matching* Show only the part of the line that matched a
pattern instead of the whole line. In this mode, no context is shown.
That is, the *-A*, *-B*, and *-C* options are ignored. If there is more
than one match in a line, each of them is shown separately, on a
separate line of output. If *-o* is combined with *-v* (invert the sense
of the match to find non-matching lines), no output is generated, but
the return code is set appropriately. If the matched portion of the line
is empty, nothing is output unless the file name or line number are
being printed, in which case they are shown on an otherwise empty line.
This option is mutually exclusive with *--output*, *--file-offsets* and
*--line-offsets*.

*-o*_number_, **--only-matching**=__number__ Show only the part of the
line that matched the capturing parentheses of the given number. Up to
50 capturing parentheses are supported by default. This limit can be
changed via the *--om-capture* option. A pattern may contain any number
of capturing parentheses, but only those whose number is within the
limit can be accessed by *-o*. An error occurs if the number specified
by *-o* is greater than the limit. +
 +
-o0 is the same as *-o* without a number. Because these options can be
given without an argument (see above), if an argument is present, it
must be given in the same shell item, for example, -o3 or
--only-matching=2. The comments given for the non-argument case above
also apply to this option. If the specified capturing parentheses do not
exist in the pattern, or were not set in the match, nothing is output
unless the file name or line number are being output. +
 +
If this option is given multiple times, multiple substrings are output
for each match, in the order the options are given, and all on one line.
For example, -o3 -o1 -o3 causes the substrings matched by capturing
parentheses 3 and 1 and then 3 again to be output. By default, there is
no separator (but see the next but one option).

**--om-capture**=__number__ Set the number of capturing parentheses that
can be accessed by *-o*. The default is 50.

**--om-separator**=__text__ Specify a separating string for multiple
occurrences of *-o*. The default is an empty string. Separating strings
are never coloured.

*-P*, *--no-ucp* Starting from release 10.43, when UTF/Unicode mode is
specified with *-u* or *-U*, the PCRE2_UCP option is used by default.
This means that the POSIX classes in patterns match more than just ASCII
characters. For example, [:digit:] matches any Unicode decimal digit.
The *--no-ucp* option suppresses PCRE2_UCP, thus restricting the POSIX
classes to ASCII characters, as was the case in earlier releases. Note
that there are now more fine-grained option settings within patterns
that affect individual classes. For example, when in UCP mode, the
sequence (?aP) restricts [:word:] to ASCII letters, while allowing \w to
match Unicode letters and digits.

*--posix-pattern-file* When patterns are provided with the *-f* option,
do not trim trailing spaces or ignore empty lines in a similar way than
other grep tools. To keep the behaviour consistent with older versions,
if the pattern read was terminated with CRLF (as character literals)
then both characters won't be included as part of it, so if you really
need to have pattern ending in '\r', use a escape sequence or provide it
by a different method.

*-q*, *--quiet* Work quietly, that is, display nothing except error
messages. The exit status indicates whether or not any matches were
found.

*-r*, *--recursive* If any given path is a directory, recursively scan
the files it contains, taking note of any *--include* and *--exclude*
settings. By default, a directory is read as a normal file; in some
operating systems this gives an immediate end-of-file. This option is a
shorthand for setting the *-d* option to "recurse".

**--recursion-limit**=__number__ This is an obsolete synonym for
*--depth-limit*. See *--match-limit* above for details.

*-s*, *--no-messages* Suppress error messages about non-existent or
unreadable files. Such files are quietly skipped. However, the return
code is still 2, even if matches were found in other files.

*-t*, *--total-count* This option is useful when scanning more than one
file. If used on its own, *-t* suppresses all output except for a grand
total number of matching lines (or non-matching lines if *-v* is used)
in all the files. If *-t* is used with *-c*, a grand total is output
except when the previous output is just one line. In other words, it is
not output when just one file's count is listed. If file names are being
output, the grand total is preceded by "TOTAL:". Otherwise, it appears
as just another number. The *-t* option is ignored when used with *-L*
(list files without matches), because the grand total would always be
zero.

*-u*, *--utf* Operate in UTF/Unicode mode. This option is available only
if PCRE2 has been compiled with UTF-8 support. All patterns (including
those for any *--exclude* and *--include* options) and all lines that
are scanned must be valid strings of UTF-8 characters. If an invalid
UTF-8 string is encountered, an error occurs.

*-U*, *--utf-allow-invalid* As *--utf*, but in addition subject lines
may contain invalid UTF-8 code unit sequences. These can never form part
of any pattern match. Patterns themselves, however, must still be valid
UTF-8 strings. This facility allows valid UTF-8 strings to be sought
within arbitrary byte sequences in executable or other binary files. For
more details about matching in non-valid UTF-8 strings, see the
link:pcre2unicode.html[*pcre2unicode*(3)] documentation.

*-V*, *--version* Write the version numbers of *pcre2grep* and the PCRE2
library to the standard output and then exit. Anything else on the
command line is ignored.

*-v*, *--invert-match* Invert the sense of the match, so that lines
which do _not_ match any of the patterns are the ones that are found.
When this option is set, options such as *--only-matching* and
*--output*, which specify parts of a match that are to be output, are
ignored.

*-w*, *--word-regex*, *--word-regexp* Force the patterns only to match
"words". That is, there must be a word boundary at the start and end of
each matched string. This is equivalent to having "\b(?:" at the start
of each pattern, and ")\b" at the end. This option applies only to the
patterns that are matched against the contents of files; it does not
apply to patterns specified by any of the *--include* or *--exclude*
options.

*-x*, *--line-regex*, *--line-regexp* Force the patterns to start
matching only at the beginnings of lines, and in addition, require them
to match entire lines. In multiline mode the match may be more than one
line. This is equivalent to having "^(?:" at the start of each pattern
and ")$" at the end. This option applies only to the patterns that are
matched against the contents of files; it does not apply to patterns
specified by any of the *--include* or *--exclude* options.

*-Z*, *--null* Terminate files names in the regular output with a zero
byte (the NUL character) instead of what would normally appear. This is
useful when file names contain unusual characters such as colons,
hyphens, or even newlines. The option does not apply to file names in
error messages.

 +
link:#TOC1[ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES] +

The environment variables *LC_ALL* and *LC_CTYPE* are examined, in that
order, for a locale. The first one that is set is used. This can be
overridden by the *--locale* option. If no locale is set, the PCRE2
library's default (usually the "C" locale) is used.

 +
link:#TOC1[NEWLINES] +

The *-N* (*--newline*) option allows *pcre2grep* to scan files with
newline conventions that differ from the default. This option affects
only the way scanned files are processed. It does not affect the
interpretation of files specified by the *-f*, *--file-list*,
*--exclude-from*, or *--include-from* options.

Any parts of the scanned input files that are written to the standard
output are copied with whatever newline sequences they have in the
input. However, if the final line of a file is output, and it does not
end with a newline sequence, a newline sequence is added. If the newline
setting is CR, LF, CRLF or NUL, that line ending is output; for the
other settings (ANYCRLF or ANY) a single NL is used.

The newline setting does not affect the way in which *pcre2grep* writes
newlines in informational messages to the standard output and error
streams. Under Windows, the standard output is set to be binary, so that
"\r\n" at the ends of output lines that are copied from the input is not
converted to "\r\r\n" by the C I/O library. This means that any messages
written to the standard output must end with "\r\n". For all other
operating systems, and for all messages to the standard error stream,
"\n" is used.

 +
link:#TOC1[OPTIONS COMPATIBILITY WITH GNU GREP] +

Many of the short and long forms of *pcre2grep*'s options are the same
as in the GNU *grep* program. Any long option of the form *--xxx-regexp*
(GNU terminology) is also available as *--xxx-regex* (PCRE2
terminology). However, the *--case-restrict*, *--depth-limit*, *-E*,
*--file-list*, *--file-offsets*, *--heap-limit*, *--include-dir*,
*--line-offsets*, *--locale*, *--match-limit*, *-M*, *--multiline*,
*-N*, *--newline*, *--no-ucp*, *--om-separator*, *--output*, *-P*, *-u*,
*--utf*, *-U*, and *--utf-allow-invalid* options are specific to
*pcre2grep*, as is the use of the *--only-matching* option with a
capturing parentheses number.

Although most of the common options work the same way, a few are
different in *pcre2grep*. For example, the *--include* option's argument
is a glob for GNU *grep*, but in *pcre2grep* it is a regular expression
to which the *-i* option applies. If both the *-c* and *-l* options are
given, GNU grep lists only file names, without counts, but *pcre2grep*
gives the counts as well.

 +
link:#TOC1[OPTIONS WITH DATA] +

There are four different ways in which an option with data can be
specified. If a short form option is used, the data may follow
immediately, or (with one exception) in the next command line item. For
example:

....
  -f/some/file
  -f /some/file
....

The exception is the *-o* option, which may appear with or without data.
Because of this, if data is present, it must follow immediately in the
same item, for example -o3.

If a long form option is used, the data may appear in the same command
line item, separated by an equals character, or (with two exceptions) it
may appear in the next command line item. For example:

....
  --file=/some/file
  --file /some/file
....

Note, however, that if you want to supply a file name beginning with ~
as data in a shell command, and have the shell expand ~ to a home
directory, you must separate the file name from the option, because the
shell does not treat ~ specially unless it is at the start of an item.

The exceptions to the above are the *--colour* (or *--color*) and
*--only-matching* options, for which the data is optional. If one of
these options does have data, it must be given in the first form, using
an equals character. Otherwise *pcre2grep* will assume that it has no
data.

 +
link:#TOC1[USING PCRE2'S CALLOUT FACILITY] +

*pcre2grep* has, by default, support for calling external programs or
scripts or echoing specific strings during matching by making use of
PCRE2's callout facility. However, this support can be completely or
partially disabled when *pcre2grep* is built. You can find out whether
your binary has support for callouts by running it with the *--help*
option. If callout support is completely disabled, callouts in patterns
are forbidden by *pcre2grep*. If the facility is partially disabled,
calling external programs is not supported, and callouts that request it
are ignored.

A callout in a PCRE2 pattern is of the form (?C<arg>) where the argument
is either a number or a quoted string (see the
link:pcre2callout.html[*pcre2callout*] documentation for details).
Numbered callouts are ignored by *pcre2grep*; only callouts with string
arguments are useful.

 +
*Echoing a specific string* +

Starting the callout string with a pipe character invokes an echoing
facility that avoids calling an external program or script. This
facility is always available, provided that callouts were not completely
disabled when *pcre2grep* was built. The rest of the callout string is
processed as a zero-terminated string, which means it should not contain
any internal binary zeros. It is written to the output, having first
been passed through the same escape processing as text from the
*--output* (*-O*) option (see above). However, $0 or $& cannot be used
to insert a matched substring because the match is still in progress.
Instead, the single character '0' is inserted. Any syntax errors in the
string (for example, a dollar not followed by another character) causes
the callout to be ignored. No terminator is added to the output string,
so if you want a newline, you must include it explicitly using the
escape $n. For example:

....
  pcre2grep '(.)(..(.))(?C"|[$1] [$2] [$3]$n")' <some file>
....

Matching continues normally after the string is output. If you want to
see only the callout output but not any output from an actual match, you
should end the pattern with (*FAIL).

 +
*Calling external programs or scripts* +

This facility can be independently disabled when *pcre2grep* is built.
It is supported for Windows, where a call to *_spawnvp()* is used, for
VMS, where *lib$spawn()* is used, and for any Unix-like environment
where *fork()* and *execv()* are available.

If the callout string does not start with a pipe (vertical bar)
character, it is parsed into a list of substrings separated by pipe
characters. The first substring must be an executable name, with the
following substrings specifying arguments:

....
  executable_name|arg1|arg2|...
....

Any substring (including the executable name) may contain escape
sequences started by a dollar character. These are the same as for the
*--output* (*-O*) option documented above, except that $0 or $& cannot
insert the matched string because the match is still in progress.
Instead, the character '0' is inserted. If you need a literal dollar or
pipe character in any substring, use $$ or $| respectively. Here is an
example:

....
  echo -e "abcde\n12345" | pcre2grep \
    '(?x)(.)(..(.))
    (?C"/bin/echo|Arg1: [$1] [$2] [$3]|Arg2: $|${1}$| ($4)")()' -

  Output:

    Arg1: [a] [bcd] [d] Arg2: |a| ()
    abcde
    Arg1: [1] [234] [4] Arg2: |1| ()
    12345
....

The parameters for the system call that is used to run the program or
script are zero-terminated strings. This means that binary zero
characters in the callout argument will cause premature termination of
their substrings, and therefore should not be present. Any syntax errors
in the string (for example, a dollar not followed by another character)
causes the callout to be ignored. If running the program fails for any
reason (including the non-existence of the executable), a local matching
failure occurs and the matcher backtracks in the normal way.

 +
link:#TOC1[MATCHING ERRORS] +

It is possible to supply a regular expression that takes a very long
time to fail to match certain lines. Such patterns normally involve
nested indefinite repeats, for example: (a+)*\d when matched against a
line of a's with no final digit. The PCRE2 matching function has a
resource limit that causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this
happens, *pcre2grep* outputs an error message and the line that caused
the problem to the standard error stream. If there are more than 20 such
errors, *pcre2grep* gives up.

The *--match-limit* option of *pcre2grep* can be used to set the overall
resource limit. There are also other limits that affect the amount of
memory used during matching; see the discussion of *--heap-limit* and
*--depth-limit* above.

 +
link:#TOC1[DIAGNOSTICS] +

Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no matches were found,
and 2 for syntax errors, overlong lines, non-existent or inaccessible
files (even if matches were found in other files) or too many matching
errors. Using the *-s* option to suppress error messages about
inaccessible files does not affect the return code.

When run under VMS, the return code is placed in the symbol PCRE2GREP_RC
because VMS does not distinguish between exit(0) and exit(1).
